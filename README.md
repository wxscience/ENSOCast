# ENSOCast
This is the code for the ENSOCast component of my website. 
You can edit the config.yml file to adjust it to your specs.

This code was created in 2018 (published in 2019) by Kyle MacRitchie 
Contact: https://www.KyleMacRitchie.com or kyle "at" macritchie "dot" me.

Feel free to improve it as you see fit and let me know if you do! This was created as a labor of love on my own time,
and as such there are probably a lot of opportunities for improvement (and bugs!).

Warning: this code uses SST and trade wind files from the Climate Prediction Center. They are freely available to the
public but sometimes are not updated on time. Therefore, be careful as you adjust the date forward in real-time.
